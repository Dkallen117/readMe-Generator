# readMe-Generator ![GitHub top language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/smcheah/README-generator)

## Description 

Having an easy to use README generator can be a vital necessity for any developer. This project allowed me to not only build a tool for myself and other users in the future, but I was able to gain more knowledge and experience using node.js and navigating and using command-line programs such as GitBash. This command-line application presents users with a series of questions that uses their inputs to easily generate a professional README file they can use for their project.
